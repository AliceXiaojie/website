Title: Final Project
Template: 720

##Introduction
Over the course of this class, you've learned a lot of new skills and
design principles around ubiquious computing and the Internet of
Things. The final project is intended for you to show everything
you've learned in the class. You will propose and build an
Internet-connected object that solves a real-world problem of your
choosing.

##Goals
Your goal is to build an Internet-connected device of some description
that solves a real-world problem. We've looked at a lot of different
devices in this class so far, and under **Resources** I've listed some
for inspiration.

##Groups
This is a group project again. You'll work in the same groups of two
as you did for GP1.

##What to do
Hereâ€™s what to do and how much of the total score for this assignment
each item will be worth (note the various due dates in the right-hand
sidebar):

- Proposal **(20%)**: Your proposal should be 2--3 pages long.
    - Define and describe your problem. What kind of problem do you
    	want to solve? Keep it simple and solvable; rather than "solve
    	world hunger," you might try "sandwich making robot." It should
    	involve an Internet-connected device.
    - Do a literature search in the HCI conferences (CHI, UIST, Ubicomp,
    	ISWC, and so on) and summarize how other people have approached
    	this or similar problems. Also look at various IoT objects at
			[iotlist.co](http://iotlist.co) and other places.
    - Describe your proposed solution.
    - Outline the steps you will take to implement your solution.
    - Note the formatting requirements under **Deliverables**.
- Project **(40%)**: Implement your solution. It must:
	- Be an Internet-connected device;
	- solve an interesting, useful, relevant, or fun problem;
	- be unrelated to your previous projects;
	- be well-grounded in the theory and literature we've discussed in
		class;
	- and it should work.
- Demo **(10%)**: Demo your working project in class.
- Video **(10%)**: Produce a 1-minute video illustrating your project.
- Final report **(20%)**: Your final report should be an extension of your
	proposal. It should add any extra literature you have found along the
	way in addition to fully describing your approach, implementation,
	successes and failures. It should be roughly in the format of a
	short conference paper, containing the usual sections such as
	"Abstract," "Introduction," "Related Work," a description of your
	system, and "Conclusions." It should include images of your project.

##Deliverables
Your proposal and final report should be in the [SIGCHI Extended
Abstracts Format](http://sigchi.github.io/Document-Formats/), in PDF,
uploaded to your Github repository. Include a Readme with a brief
description of your project, and links to the PDF and video. The video
should be hosted on either YouTube or Vimeo.
